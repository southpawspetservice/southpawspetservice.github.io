            <p>As a dog owner for 26 years I understand the need of dogs and other pets for love and affections on a daily basis.  I also understand the sense of abandonment or separation anxiety that a pet can experience when left at home alone during the work day or at veterinarian kennels or boarding facilities.</p>
            <p>These facilities can also become fairly expensive and can take away from vacation plans due to the higher costs and limited availabilities to accommodate your pet(s).  It is well known that pets that get regular exercise tend to live longer and have healthier lives.  It is our goal to provide you a better option for your pet(s) health and well-being, your budget, and your sound piece of mind knowing that your pet(s) are being given quality personalized care.</p>
