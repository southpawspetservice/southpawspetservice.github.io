            <p>I decided to open this business primarily because of my love for dogs. I also realized that there were
                very limited options for people in the Hampton Roads area who want their dogs to get the exercise they
                need but who are either too busy or unable to exercise them. I really enjoy walking dogs and I know they
                just love being walked. It gives me so much satisfaction knowing that the dogs are getting the exercise
                they need to live a longer and healthier life.</p>
