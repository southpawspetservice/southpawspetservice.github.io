            <p class="card-body">It is more than just dog walking to me. I was blessed to have found South Paws Pet Service because they have been a major influence on my life and, because of their services, I was able to get my life back together (while I was unable to walk my dog for health reasons). I thought the customer service was fantastic. I was very happy with it. They went above and beyond what they were supposed to do.</p>

            <p class="card-body">Clare Sarros of South Paws Pet Service is a true HERO to our babies. I have a quirky schedule and my wife works long hours. Clare was extremely helpful in adjusting her time to accommodate ours. I have been home a time or two when Clare has come to walk our babies and I&#039;ve never seen them so happy. Clare also made herself available on short notice when I had to go out of town for a family emergency. If you are looking for a reliable, trustworthy, and reasonably priced pet sitter/dog walker, Clare Sarros of South Paws Pet Service is the one for you.</p>

            <p class="card-body">My 4-year old yellow lab, Winston, was terribly overweight. My health problems prevented from walking him or playing with him in the backyard. I reached out to South Paws Pet Service who has now been walking Winston 4 days a week. He has now lost 15 pounds and on the way to losing more. I couldn&#039;t be more delighted with his progress and only have South Paws Pet Service to thank for it.</p>
